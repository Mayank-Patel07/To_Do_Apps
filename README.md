📝 Todo Apps (Vanilla JS & React + Bootstrap)
📖 Description
This project is a comparison of two Todo List Applications built using different technologies:

A Vanilla JavaScript version (HTML, CSS, and JS)

A React version styled with Bootstrap 5

Both versions provide a simple and clean interface to manage your daily tasks. Users can add, complete, and delete tasks. One of the key features is that all todos are automatically saved in the browser’s local storage, so your data remains available even after refreshing or closing the browser.

This project is great for:

Beginners learning JavaScript and React

Exploring how the same functionality can be implemented using different frameworks

Understanding how local storage works

Comparing styling with and without a UI library (Bootstrap)

💾 Local Storage Support
Both versions of the app use local storage to persist data:

✅ Todos are automatically saved whenever you add, update, or delete a task

✅ When you revisit or reload the page, your todos remain intact

✅ No backend or external database required
